### Short Version
Hello! My name is Eric Dietz and I manage a security operations center for a mid-sized company.  I use this site to write about cybersecurity, leadership, and a handful of other topics.

### Long Version
So if you read the short version - yes, I'm a SOC manager and I'd officially call that my career at this point, even though I've only been at it for a short time. You see, I didn't necessarily plan to work in cybersecurity.  In college, I studied history and political science. I then went on to get my law degree where I had an affinity for tax and bankruptcy law - and even worked in a bankruptcy court for a few years (thankfully as a clerk, not because I had declared bankruptcy).  But after working in law for a bit, I had a bit of a personal crisis.  I loved the academic and analytical aspects of law, but that wasn't much of the actual job.  If I'm being completely honest, I was a bit naive about the nature of work and hoping that I'd be working on novel legal theories in my very first job wasn't realistic.
