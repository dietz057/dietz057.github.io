### Short Version
Hello! My name is Eric Dietz and I manage a security operations center for a mid-sized company.  I use this site to write about cybersecurity, leadership, and a handful of other topics.

### Long Version
So if you read the short version - yes, I'm a SOC manager and I'd officially call that my career at this point, even though I've done a variety of different things over my professional career.  I didn't necessarily plan to work in cybersecurity.  In college, I studied history and political science. I then went on to get my law degree where I had an affinity for tax and bankruptcy law - and even worked in a bankruptcy court for a few years (thankfully as a clerk, not because I had declared bankruptcy).  But after working in law for a bit, I had a bit of a personal crisis.  I loved the academic and analytical aspects of law, but a sizable amount of legal work involves conflict - and I am generally someone that like collaboration over conflict.  This led me to returning to school to study software engineering with an ultimate goal of moving into patent law.  Rather than finding a love for coding, I gravitated toward cybersecurity.  I leveraged that interest into a SOC position with a company and the rest is history.

### Why am I writing this?
I am a firm believer that writing about a problem is a way for you to organize your thoughts on that problem.  It's a proxy for how well one can think.  So, part of this blog is purely for me to double-dip on problem solving I would usually do for work, but be able to share that problem solving with others.

Another reason is for professional reasons.  I really like the idea of potential employers being able to read my thoughts in a single location and get a picture of who I am.  When a company is hiring a SOC manager, it's important that they're a good fit for the company and match what you're looking for.  I think this blog could serve as a way for a future employer to quickly understand if I'm someone they'd be interested in, thus saving us all a lot of time.
